# Secure Web Api

This is a serverless base project. **WORK IN PROGRESS**

## Description

This is a basis for a secure serverless web api. Firstly, it's a basic implementation, meaning it's supposed to be expanded on. It holds simple implementations to get a secure web api up and running, but it's not complete. Second; it's serverless. It's done with Azure Functions V3. I know; cloud... serverless... pretty hipp to the hop.

## Todo

- Move stuff to configuration (I see you jwtKey)
- Tests
